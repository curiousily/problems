<p>
For many sets of consecutive integers from 1 through N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 39),
one can partition the set into two sets whose sums are identical.

</p><p>
For example, if N=3, one can partition the set {1, 2, 3} in one way so
that the sums of both subsets are identical:
</p><ul>
        <li>{3} and {1,2}
</li></ul>

<p>
This counts as a single partitioning (i.e., reversing the order counts
as the same partitioning and thus does not increase the count of
partitions).

</p><p>
If N=7, there are four ways to partition the set {1, 2, 3, ... 7} so that
each partition has the same sum:
</p><ul>
        <li>{1,6,7} and {2,3,4,5}
        </li><li>{2,5,7} and {1,3,4,6}
        </li><li>{3,4,7} and {1,2,5,6}
        </li><li>{1,2,4,7} and {3,5,6}
</li></ul>

<p>
Given N,  your program should print the number of ways a set containing
the integers from 1 through N can be partitioned into two sets whose
sums are identical.  Print 0 if there are no such ways.

</p><p>
Your program must calculate the answer, not look it up from a table.
</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: subset</h3>
<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>
The input file contains a single line with a single integer representing
N, as above.
<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file subset.in)</h3>
<pre>7
</pre>
<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>
<p>
The output file contains a single line with a single integer that tells
how many same-sum partitions can be made from the set {1, 2, ..., N}.
The output file should contain 0 if there are no ways to make a
same-sum partition.
</p><h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file subset.out)</h3>
<pre>4
</pre>
